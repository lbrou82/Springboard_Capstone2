Capstone
==============================

Second Capstone - Image Classification
------------

There are millions of different types of wildlife in the world. Can we use image classification to distinguish some of them? iNaturalist, a site that allows users to add images of wildlife they observe, hosts an annual Kaggle competition that encourages participants to help improve image classification for their repository of images.


This project uses jpeg images from 1010 different species and 6 wildlife categories from the 2019 iNaturalist dataset. While the original Kaggle competition sought to classify one species from another - for instance, a bee vs a yellowjacket, this project attempts to classify images of Birds from other categories of wildlife. 

The entire dataset is too large to be uploaded to this repository, but can be found on the Kaggle site: https://www.kaggle.com/c/inaturalist-2019-fgvc6/overview.
